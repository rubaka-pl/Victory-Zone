I recently completed a project where I developed a dynamic website using JavaScript, Gulp, and SCSS. The site features dynamically generated sections for both cards and tournaments, which allows for easy content updates and management without altering the core HTML structure. I used Gulp for the build process, incorporating SCSS with variables and mixins to ensure the stylesheets are both scalable and maintainable. Additionally, images are optimized and served in WebP format for improved performance.

One significant challenge was tracking dynamic content updates. I resolved this by using the MutationObserver API to ensure that filters and cards are updated in real-time as content changes.

The entire site is compact, weighing in at a modest 669 KB.

You can easily expand the siteâ€™s functionality by adding new objects directly to the main.js file. For instance, you can add a new game card with just the following object structure:

```javascript
{
    name: "str",
    image: "img/game.webp",
    price: "str",
    platform: "str",
    slots: int,
}
```
