# Project Description

In this project, I developed a website with a focus on optimizing and automating the development workflow using **Gulp**. The project encompasses several key features and improvements:

## 🚀 Gulp Automation

- **Gulp** was implemented for task automation:
  - **Cleaning directories**
  - **Minifying HTML**
  - **Compiling SCSS to CSS**
  - **Optimizing JavaScript**
  - **Compressing images**

## 🃏 Dynamic Card Management

- Implemented functionality for dynamically adding cards to the webpage.
- Managed card data, including names, images, and prices, through JavaScript, allowing for easy updates and maintenance.

## 💾 Local Storage

- Integrated **local storage** to save and persist user data across sessions.
- Ensures user interactions, such as adding cards, are preserved even after page reloads.

## 🌐 Development Server

- Set up a local development server using `browser-sync` for:
  - **Live reloading**
  - **Real-time preview of changes** during development
